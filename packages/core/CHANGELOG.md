## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 95ec001: Improve dual ESM/CJS type resolution.

  `exports['.']` (and the `./mcp` / `./pgvector` subpath exports) now declare
  separate `import.types` and `require.types` conditions — `.d.ts` is served to
  ESM consumers and `.d.cts` to CJS consumers. This eliminates the
  `@arethetypeswrong/cli` `FalseESM` warnings that v0.1.1 still produced and
  makes `moduleResolution: "node16" / "nodenext" / "bundler"` consumers see the
  correct type files for their runtime.

  Also:

  - `attw` scripts pinned to `--profile=node16` so legacy `node10` resolution
    stays informational (subpath exports require `node16+` resolution).
  - `publint` and `attw` now pass cleanly for all nine published packages.
  - No runtime behaviour change.
